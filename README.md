DATA SCIENCE
Description:
This project implements an extractive summarization technique to automatically generate concise summaries from lengthy documents.
It reads PDF files, processes the text, and identifies the most important sentences using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity scoring.
The approach ensures that the resulting summary retains the key points and context of the original document while reducing its length.
Developed in Python, the project utilizes libraries such as PyPDF2 for PDF reading, Scikit-learn for text vectorization, and NLTK/Regex for sentence tokenization.
The tool can be applied to research papers, reports, articles, or any long-form text to save time and improve productivity.
It is scalable, easy to use, and can be extended with advanced NLP models for domain-specific summarization needs.
The repository includes the implementation code, a sample PDF for testing, and a formatted report showcasing the summarization output.
